<p>This is the libcloud meta-adapter for Nanobox.</p>

<p>The adapters currently supported by this meta-adapter are:</p>

<ul>
  {% for adapter in adapters %}
    <li><a href="/{{ adapter._get_id() }}">{{ adapter.name }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>From your Nanobox Dashboard, if you don't see the associated adapter there already (you should, if it's here, unless it's still in development), create a new Hosting Account with a Custom Provider, and provide the adapter's URL as the Provider Endpoint. Then, simply follow the instructions to set up your hosting account.</p>

<p>For those interested, you can explore the actual adapter APIs yourself at <a href="/docs">{{ url_for('docs', _external=True) }}</a>.</p>
